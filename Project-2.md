### Problem statement:
Use two rotary encoders to draw whatever picture in 64 x 64 RGB LED Matrix Panel

### Ideation:

Rotary encoder >> Arduino nano >>  RPi >> RGB Matrix HAT >> 64 x 64 RGB LED Matrix Panel

DOF sensor is used to erase random 5 pixels and a push button is used to erase totally.

##### My idea:

Rotary encoder >> Arduino Mega >> 64 x 64 RGB LED Matrix Panel 

Instead of using DOF sensor, push button to erase the last pixel and a toggle switch to erase totally
